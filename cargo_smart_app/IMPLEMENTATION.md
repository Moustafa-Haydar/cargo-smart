- **Base URL**: Configurable API endpoints

### UI/UX
- **Material Design**: Modern Material Design 3 components
- **Responsive Design**: ScreenUtil for responsive layouts
- **Custom Themes**: Consistent color scheme and typography
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading and progress indicators

### Data Persistence
- **SharedPreferences**: Token and user data storage
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted token storage
- **Offline Support**: Basic offline state handling

## API Endpoints Used

### Authentication
- `POST /accounts/mobile/login/` - User login
- `GET /accounts/mobile/profile/` - Get user profile
- `POST /accounts/mobile/logout/` - User logout

### Shipments
- `GET /shipments/mobile/driver/shipments/` - Get driver shipments
- `GET /shipments/mobile/driver/shipment/{id}/` - Get shipment details
- `POST /shipments/mobile/driver/shipment/{id}/delivered/` - Mark as delivered
- `POST /shipments/mobile/driver/shipment/{id}/status/` - Update status
